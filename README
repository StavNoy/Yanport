# Use:

## CLI
1. Navigate to `out/production/Yanport/`

2. Launch Main with arguments in order:
   grid-x grid-y start-x start-y start-direction instructions
   i.e: `java com.ihoover.Main 10 10 5 5 N ADAGGA`

## From source:
Change elements of `main` methods' `uses` array, recompile and rerun.
Example element: `new String[]{"10", "10", "5", "5", "N", "ADAGGA"}`


# Assumptions:

1. If given size x: 10 y: 10, grid is 10x10, not 11x11
2. The vacuum will ignore `A` commands to out of it's grid
   For example, when in position `0,0` facing `S`, `A` will be ignored
